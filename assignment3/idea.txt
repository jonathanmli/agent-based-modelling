idea for assignment3

*Summary

- Use the model of assignment2

- use batch run and change the following parameter

1. step_by_type
2. gross_regrowth_time
3. initial_sheep
4. initial_wolves

- Also, run original model and intelligent model separately.

*Why are these parameters important?

1. step_by_type

    Just make sure the initialization matters or not in this model

    -- if not, compare the original vs intelligent model. The rule change should matter because the result was 
	totally different.

2. gross_regrowth_time

    This can be interpreted as "climate shock." Due to climate change or some reason, the rainfall would be vary
    and this affects the gross regrowth. By changing this parameter, we can evaluate the impact of the climete shock on the wolves and sheep.

3 & 4. initial sheep
    
    This can be interpreted as the population density and relative size of each species. Each area has characteristic,
    like some areas has a lot of sheep compare to wolves, or vice versa. If this setting is matter, we have to careful
    about the initial setting.
